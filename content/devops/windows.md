## Chocolatey
Don't install packages the ~~barbaric~~ old-fashioned way, use [Chocolatey](https://chocolatey.org/).

Useful commands:

- **List installed packages**, `clist -lo`

See also: the [commandslist doco](https://chocolatey.org/docs/commandslist).

## XAMPP

Download from [apachefriends.org](apachefriends.org). It's a nice quick and dirty web server environment:

- Apache
- mySQL
- PHP
